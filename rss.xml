                Hello readers. I'm Luke Scott a web and game developer from North West England, and this is my blog. The purpose of this
                blog is for me to talk about the ideas behind my games, updates and projects. Projects being tools, websites and just
                kinda anything. I also want to talk a bit about myself and my thoughts between and/or as part of other updates. I'm
                still unsure how often this blog will be updated.
