Hello ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m Luke Scott a computer science graduate from NW England, and I build all sorts of programs, websites and video games. Iâ€™ve studied computer science at Lancaster University, and I am interested in software and game programming alongside web development.

During my studies Iâ€™ve worked on other projects and used a variety of technologies including: Java, C#, HTML, CSS, JS, paintdotnet/gmic, WordPress, Python, Git, Flexbox, Jekyll and Unity.

Alongside playing video games I like going on walks and going to rock and metal shows. Iâ€™ve helped organise gigs in the past as the President of Lancaster University Rock and Metal Society.
