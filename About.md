Hello ðŸ‘‹ 
Iâ€™m Luke Scott a computer science student from NW England, and I build all sorts of programs, websites and video games. I've studied computer science at Lancaster University.

I've used a variety of technologies including: Java, C#, HTML, CSS, JS, WordPress, Python, Flexbox, Jekyll and Unity.

Alongside playing video games I like going to rock and metal shows. I've helped organise gigs in the past as the President of Lancaster University RocSoc.
