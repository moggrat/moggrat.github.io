            <p>
                Hello reader. I'm Luke a web/game developer from NW England, and this is my blog. The purpose of this blog is for me to
                talk about the ideas behind my games/projects/updates. Project being tools, websites and just kinda anything. I also
                want to talk a bit about myself and my thoughts between and/or as part of other updates. I'm still unsure how often this
                blog will be updated.
            </p>

            <p>Onto what I have been up to:</p>

            <p>All my maintained sites are undergoing minor refactoring. This site has had some aesthetic changes too; in addition to the implementation of this blog.</p>

            <p>The other site that is going to receive a large update is my "Civilization VI Shuffle &amp; Randomization" site. 
                The new design should work much better on mobile devices.  The current site (for some reason) is missing a viewport meta tag. 
                The "Regional Civilization Randomizer" has been updated for the new "New Frontier" pack (Portugal Civilization and Zombie game mode). 
                However, the Map randomizer is out of date. I plan to retire the map randomizer; I may leave this as a legacy page on the site in the next update. 
                I'll be making another blog post when I finish this update.
            </p>

            <p>Regarding game development, I haven't been too active on my game. 
                I will focus on game development once I've finished all my website updates. In the past, 
                I perhaps would have said "I'll wait till I have more time", but I need to make time. On another note, later in April, 
                I may join a game jam, so I'm looking forward to that.
            </p>

            <p>Thanks for reading; I hope future posts will be more insightful.</p>
