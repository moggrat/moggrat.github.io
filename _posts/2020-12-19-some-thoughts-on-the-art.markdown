I haven't been able to work on many personal things lately. However, I have made notes on my next game/project's story/style. In this post I want to talk about art style (I mostly work on 3D games at the moment, so I'm limiting this post to 3D art styles). 

The three 3D styles I love and have the ability to create using the tools currently at my disposal are realism, low-poly(textured) and anime/manga. I intend to use these style in my future games (at least those I create solo).

For my current project, I want to have a horror-esque atmosphere. Although possible, I doubt my ability to achieve this with an anime/manga influenced art style. This style is one I intend to use for future projects (either less horror or more psychological horror). Realism would be a popular style with a wider audience, but it is limited to small scope projects.

Finally, this leaves low-poly. I divide Low poly into two categories flat-shaded and retro; flat-shaded in my opinion is best suited for showing cute/positive theming. Although it could act as a contrast to horror, I believe it would not suit this project; so I have chosen the retro styling. This retro look might look ugly to some, but it has been growing in popularity the last few years with FPS games like Dusk and Horror games like Paratopic. 

All three styles I love, but I initially found it a struggle to decide on a style. So I wrote notes down and turned it into this post. Hope you've enjoyed reading some thoughts I've had.
