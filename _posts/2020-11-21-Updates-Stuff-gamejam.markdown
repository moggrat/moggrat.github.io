Since the last update on my blog I now official have a BSc Hons Computer Science degree. I'm still very busy though (ðŸ˜‰). 
This post is to give an idea of stuff I'm working on at the moment. 

I am still updating the Civilization VI Shuffle & Randomization web tool to account for game updates and frontier pass content. 
The new civilization Babylonia and the Heroes & Legends game mode have been added. 

Additionally, the next project I'm currently working on is a game for the GitHub Game Off 2020 game jam. The theme for this jam is "MOONSHOT".
I've got the core mechanics sorted, and I just need to work on assets and levels before the end of the month. 
I've been planning on streaming on twitch more and I might stream myself creating these levels and assets.
