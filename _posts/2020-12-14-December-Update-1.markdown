Happy Holidays.

Hope everyone who is reading this is doing well. Since the last post I've been very busy. However, I still have stuff to talk about.

Firstly, I submitted my prototype game "MOON MISS SHOT" into the GitHub Game Off 2020 game jam. The theme was MOONSHOT. This theme alongside other inspirations resulted in me developing a 3D gravity system and the game around said system. I submitted this over 10 days ago now but I've only just had time to update the site.

On that note the site update...

I've made the blog its own page, separated games + projects and added recent project section on the home page. The sites colours have changed to match the recent project also. I plan on redoing the games page and adding some flair to the site soon.
